\paragraph{Section 1}
If the disk is replaced, the improvement fraction $F$ is $0.25$.
The improvement speedup $S(m)$ will be $4$.
Consequently, applying Amdahl's Law, we get:

\[
S = \frac{1}{0.75 + \frac{0.25}{4}} = \frac{1}{0.8125} =  1.2308
\]

\paragraph{Section 2}
If the processor is replaced, the improvement speedup is given by the ratio
between the ne number of cores $n_n$ and the old number of colres $n_o$.

\[
S_m = \frac{n_n}{n_o} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

The improvement fraction $F$ is in this case $0.5$.
\[
S = \frac{1}{0.5 + \frac{0.5}{8}} = \frac{1}{0.5 + 0.0625} = \frac{1}{0.5625} = 1.7778
\]

\paragraph{Section 3}
The improvement speedup for a given number of cores $n$, is:

\[
S_i = \frac{n}{4}
\]

Consequently, the total speedup is:

\[
S = \frac{1}{0.5 + 
\frac{0.5}{\frac{n}{4}}} = 
\frac{1}{0.5 + \frac{2}{n}}
\]

If we make this value equal to $\frac{1}{0.8125}$, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{0.8125} = \frac{1}{0.5+\frac{2}{n}}
\]
\[ 0.8125 = 0.5 + \frac{2}{n} \]
\[ \frac{2}{n} = 0.8125 - 0.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{2}{0.3125} = 6.4 \]

Consequently a minimum of 7 cores are needed.
