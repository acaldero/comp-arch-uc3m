The execution of a program has two parts. The first part requires 20\% of the
total execution time and the second part the remaining 80\%. The second part can
be parallelized using OpenMP in a multiprocessor. Assume that the speedup is
perfect for any number of processors. What would be the overall speedup of the
application when 10 processors are used?


\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

It is enough with the application of Amdahl's Law with values
$0.2$ for the sequential part and $0.8$ for the parallel part.

\[
S = \frac{1}{0.2 + \frac{0.8}{10}} = \frac{1}{0.2 + 0.08} = \frac{1}{0.28} =
3.57
\]
