During one year a computer has been working all the time except a single
failure that required shutting down the system for one day.

Answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Compute the system availability during that year.

  \item Is it possible that another computer that has 4 failures during a year
has the same availability value? Reason your answer.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

\begin{enumerate}

\item

During one year, the system was working correctly during 364 days and was out of service
for one day.

\[
A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTR} = \frac{364}{365} = 0.9973 \quad
\rightarrow \quad 99.73\%
\]

\item

Yes. If repair time for 4 failures equals to 1 day, the availability would be the same. 

For example, if the system is not available for one whole day is equivalent
to being not available 6 hours in 4 different days.

\end{enumerate}
