\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}[t]{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item C++ offers a concurrency model through a combination of
        language and library.
  \item Class \cppid{thread} abstracts an OS thread.
  \item Synchronization through a combination of \cppid{mutex} and \cppid{condition\_variable}.
  \item \cppid{std::async} offers a high-level mechanism to run threads.
  \item \cppid{std::future} allows result and exceptions transfer among threads.
\end{itemize}
