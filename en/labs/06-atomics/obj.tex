\section{Objective}

The main goal of this lab is to exercise the concept of concurrency as well as
the memory model and its impact in the presence and removal of data races.

In particular you will learn to:


\begin{itemize}

  \item Compile a multi-threaded program.
  \item Detect data races through program dynamic analysis.
  \item Fix data races.
  \item Evaluate the performance of concurrent solutions.
  \item Compare lock based and lock free solutions.

\end{itemize}
