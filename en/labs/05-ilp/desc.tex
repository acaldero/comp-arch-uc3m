\section{Lab description}

In this lab you will carry out the evaluation of running several
C++ programs analyzing performance and studying to values obtained
from hardware counters.

Please, remind that for compiling a program with debug options
(and without optimizations) you must generate a \emph{debug} configuration.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal,aboveskip=1em,belowskip=1em]
cmake -S . -B debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
\end{lstlisting}

If you want to generate a configuration with all optimizations
enabled, you will have to generate a \emph{release} configuration.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal,aboveskip=1em,belowskip=1em]
cmake -S . -B release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
\end{lstlisting}

Additionally, to compile a give configuration, you must invoke \cppkey{cmake}
with the corresponding configuration name:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal,aboveskip=1em,belowskip=1em]
cmake --build release
\end{lstlisting}

\textbad{REMINDER}: 
To run jobs in the \cppid{avignon} cluster, you must first create a
script to launch the compilation.
