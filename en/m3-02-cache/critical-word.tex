\section{Critical word first and early restart}

\begin{frame}[t]{Critical word first and early restart}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textmark{Observation}: 
        Usually processors need a single word to proceed.

  \mode<presentation>{\vfill\pause}
  \item \textgood{Solution}: 
        Do not wait until the whole block from memory has been transferred.

  \mode<presentation>{\vfill\pause}
  \item \textgood{Alternatives}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textmark{Critical word first}: 
            Reorder blocks so that first word is the word needed by the processor.

      \item \textmark{Early restart}: 
            Block received without reordering.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item As soon as the selected word is received, the processor proceeds.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \mode<presentation>{\vfill\pause}
  \item \textmark{Effects}:
        Depends on block size $\rightarrow$ the larger the better.
