Consider what would be the impact if the voltage cannot be reduced below 50\% although
frequency can still be reduced to 10\% of its original value. Determine the expected
savings.

\begin{acsolution}
\end{acsolution}

The energy ratio is:
\[
\frac{E_{new}}{E_{old}} =
\frac{(0.5 \cdot \times V_{old})^2}{V_{old}^2} =
0.5^2 =
0.25
\] 

And the power ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_{new}}{P_{old}} =
\frac{(0.5 \cdot V_{old})^2 \cdot 0.1 \cdot f}{V_{old}^2 \cdot f} =
0.5^2 \cdot 0.1 =
0.025
\]
