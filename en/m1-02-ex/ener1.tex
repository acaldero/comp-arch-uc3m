Consider a large data center with many servers. The data center operates most of 
the time at 50\% of its capacity. However, 10\% of the time it operates at its
full capacity. When the servers operate at 50\% of its capacity 90\% of the power
is consumed. Server nodes can be put into a suspend mode where they only use
20\% of the power.

Consider the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item How much would be the power saving by suspending 50\% of the servers
compared to turning off the servers.

\item How much power saving can be obtained by decreasing voltage 10\% and 
frequency by 25\%.

\item How much would be the power saving by suspending 25\% of the servers
and turning off 25\% of the servers

\end{enumerate}
