Consider that the 4-core processor is replaced by a processor with one performance core (one of the original cores) and one energy core. The energy core requires 30\% of one energy of the performance core.

When running messaging applications, the performance core is used 20\% of the time and the
energy core is used 80\% of the time.

What would be the required energy.

\begin{acsolution}\end{acsolution}

The performance core would be running 20\% of the time using $\frac{1}{4}$ of the energy.
The energy core would be running 80\% of the time using $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 30\%$ of the energy.

\[
E_d = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 0.3 =
0.05 + 0.06 = 
0.11
\]
